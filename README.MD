## PSAM 5020: Machine Learning

Machine learning is the systematic study of algorithms and systems that improve their knowledge and performance with experience. Collecting and analyzing data through machine learning algorithms and models can uncover complex patterns in massive amounts of data to make more accurate predictions and to reveal coherent dimensions. The course covers classification, regression, and clustering models to predict and describe, using supervised and unsupervised learning methods. Special attention will be given to models and techniques that aid and support the visualization of complex data.
