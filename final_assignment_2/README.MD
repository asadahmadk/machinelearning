# Plane Images

### Changes in Feature

Using scikit-images [https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/] documentation I used three different functions to process my images. 

1. Corner Fast - extracts FAST corners for a given image.

2. Corner Shi Tomsi - computes Shi-Tomasi (Kanade-Tomasi) corner measure response image.

3. Hough - performs a circular Hough transform of the image

### Submission
For my final submission I used a combination of corner shi tomsi (neural network) and hough (neural network and perceptron model)
